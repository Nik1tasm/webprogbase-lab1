            <p class="content-user-info">Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens, and received
                his B.S. degree in economics from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He took charge
                of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded it from
                Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and
                golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. He managed the
                company until his 2017 inauguration. He is credited as co-author of several books, including The Art of
                the Deal. He owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and produced and
                hosted The Apprentice, a reality television show, from 2003 to 2015. Forbes estimates his net worth to
                be $3.1 billion. </p>
